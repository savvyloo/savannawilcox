        <b><p>Hello to all,</p>

              <p>My name is Savanna Wilcox, however everyone calls me Savvy.</p>
              
              <p>I specialize in creating engaging web sites.
              I've been creating web sites since the MySpace days, 
              as of now I am 35 years old and started my interest in coding at 13. 
              My interest dwindled through the years as life happened, and now I'm 
              back to learning my passion and expanding my knowledge. I am 
              currently persuing my bachelors degree in coding. 
              My skills include HTML and CSS and currently learning CSS Grid, 
              Javascript, SQL Databases, and Flexbox. I've had experience with Dreamweaver 
              and Visual Studio Code. Aside from coding I am also a Registered Yoga Instructor, 
              I finished my 200 hours with Jody Augustine in Loup City Nebraska, 
              she has over 3000 hours logged under her and I grew immensely 
              under her care and guidance. I am a very driven individual and am 
              quick to learn and devour any new information. I'm constantly growing, 
              not only in my field of study, but as a compassionate human being. I look forward to working with you.</p></b>
