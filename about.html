          <p><b>As someone who has been in the service industry her whole life, 
            I meet unexpected challenges daily and have great rapport with my customers. 
            I thrive on fast pace work, and am very passionate about expanding my knowledge and skills. 
            I work very well in a group setting, and have cultivated a deep compassion for understanding 
            others. When I lead my team, I lead by example and help their growth by listening to their needs, 
            observing their struggles and gently pointing them in the direction to help them 
            create the best version of themselves. I listen to any ideas they have to contribute 
            to the company and work with them through any concerns they may have. 
            My decision making skills have been honed through the many years of the restaurant 
            life and I thrive and succeed under pressure. I feel this will carry through to my 
            field and help in my own success as well as the success of the business I work for. </b></p>
